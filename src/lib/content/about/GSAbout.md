**Gamma Space, once a thriving events hub and coworking space for indie devs in Toronto's downtown West Queen West neighborhood, has transformed over the last year to a not-for-profit, distributed member co-op.**

We are a group of game developers, artists, and creative technologists dedicated to exploring more community-led, collectively prosperous ways to care for, support and raise each other up.

Since 2012, we’ve been making space for those who have been marginalized from tech spaces – now we’re working together to redefine equitable creative practices and shared value for our efforts.

We’ll be sharing more information about how you can get involved soon.
