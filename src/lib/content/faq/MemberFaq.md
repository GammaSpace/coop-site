## Who are your members?

As of mid 2023, we are a small but committed group of experienced & novice collectivists who have spent the last few years defining, refining, and practicing the structures that help our community thrive. The majority of us are game developers. We bring a broad diversity of skills, goals, and interests, but we're all dedicated to nurturing **sustainable spaces of personal and collective transformation**. 

## Are there different types of membership? What about extended community/supporters?

Full membership in Gamma Space has two broad requirements: **alignment with our community principles and practices**, and a commitment to building shared capacity through a **flexible exchange of individual and collective value**. We teach the first part in our member onboarding process described in the next answer. The rest is more fluid, but all members agree to a **70-30 balance** between personal projects and community goals. These contributions take many forms, but include stuff like hosting social check-ins, facilitating workshops and/or trainings, and creating the tools and content we all use to make and share games. Beyond formal membership, We maintain strong ties with legacy Gamma Space members through our community Slack channels, and welcome opportunities to connect with other co-ops, artists, activists, and organizations with shared values!

## Why become a member at all? Is it just a bunch of rules to follow?

At first glance, it might seem like co-op membership is just more dos and don'ts on top of the hard work of being an independent artist. We know it's a lot! But remember: the purpose of Gamma Space is to build alternatives to the creative, economic, and political structures we know _aren't working_. We're not just here to make better games, we're here to **make _making_ games** more **equitable, empowering, and regenerative** _for everyone_. And while that takes commitment and patience, we know that our practices generate value and care and that the status quo never will. 

## OK, sold! How do I join?

All Gamma Space members participate in a **multi-week onboarding process** to learn the values and systems our community is built around. This includes personal reflections and expectation-setting, understanding and practicing Value Flow, and opportunities for one-on-one and community-wide engagement. We work hard to keep the commitment reasonable, but we've found it's essential to spend quality time getting to know each other, aligning our values, and gaining hands on experience in co-op activities. Right now, onboardings are offered to small groups based on interest and internal capacity. **Please reach out** if you're interested in joining our next cohort, and we'll keep you posted.
