We commit to actively working to inform, learn, teach, activate, model, and champion values and practices of anti-oppression and decolonization in all community activities and shared spaces. We understand this to be an iterative, humbling and rewarding process that requires time, care, compassion, love, attention, courageous and gracious commitment; that it involves continuous self-examination concerning our roles in society, culture, and history; and that it **extends beyond compliance** with diversity and human rights standards. Our goal is to dismantle power and privilege and mitigate systemic inequalities for those most affected by oppression and colonization â€“ while investing in both personal growth and collective well-being.
