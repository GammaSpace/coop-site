<div><p>Impact investors <a href= "https://weirdghosts.ca/">Weird Ghosts</a> and Gamma Space have teamed up to offer a grant of <b>$25,000</b> in a two-part, <b>six-month program</b> of tailored mentorship with a community of game-making peers. We offer the space and the tools to develop studios led by <a href= "https://weirdghosts.ca/faq#what-is-an-underrepresented-identity-group">underrepresented founders</a> that don't need to adhere to inequitable systemic norms.</p>
<p>The program is based on our community's collectively developed peer mentorship model to help game-makers address the challenges in the "three Ps": Process, Product, and Pitch.</p></div>
<div><!--p>This program is facilitated by Gamma Space members datejie cheko green, kaitlyn dougon, bryan depuy and Henry Faber; Weird Ghosts founders Eileen Mary Holowka and Jennie Robinson Faber.
</p--><p>Cohorts in 2022 and 2023 were also supported by the Ontario Creates Capacity Development program.</p>
