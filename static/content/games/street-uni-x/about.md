daffodil & friends is the gaming label of daffodil jenx and their collaborators. Working from a common framework of inclusivity and non-exploitation, daffodil & friends came together, including Brodie Anderson-Pilon (environment and prop artist) and Jesse Cramer (sound design), to develop Street Uni X.

### About daffodil

daffodil Jenx is a non-binary, multidisciplinary artist and athlete. They combine street sports, clowning, music-making, and game development into a truly unique personal style that celebrates our collective differences while always ensuring visibility on those marginalized from creative and tech spaces.

daffodil became a Gamma Space community in 2022 as a _Baby Ghost_, a participant in [Weird Ghosts x Gamma Space Peer Accelerator](https://weirdghosts.ca/baby-ghosts). They later became a full Gamma Space member in 2023, where they have been contributing to the community not only through their game design and programming expertise, but as a valued part of all social activities.
