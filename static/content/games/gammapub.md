Our co-op's publishing node supports the production, marketing, launch, and post-launch activities of games created by our members, ensuring the studio's **impact goals** are recognized as importantly as their game's *features*.

Our not-for-profit model encourages a regenerative approach to community support that includes funding, project management, audience development, and platform support.

Our first games include Rocket Adrift's [Psychroma](/games/psychroma) and daffodil & friends' [Street Uni X](/games/street-uni-x). For media inquiries, please contact us via [media@gammaspace.ca](mailto:media@gammaspace.ca)
