Currently in development with support from [Weird Ghosts](https://weirdghosts.ca/) and the Canadian Government's [Investment Readiness Program](https://irp-ppi.ca/en/), our **not-for-profit community publishing program** is a regenerative model for supporting the pre-development, production, launch, and post-launch of member games through funding, project management, audience development, and platform support.

We are currently producing three games from our member community and will be announcing further details soon!
