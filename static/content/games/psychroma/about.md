Rocket Adrift Games is a Toronto-based indie studio made up of Sloane Smith, Lindsay Rollins and Titus McNally. They make narrative-driven games that include their previous games [Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance](https://rocketadrift.com/raptorboyfriend/), and [Order A Pizza: A Visual Novel](https://rocketadrift.com/order-a-pizza-a-visual-novel/).

Our Mission as a developer is to tell personal narratives that highlight the perspectives of LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC experiences while also showcasing an outsider lens to Canadian culture.

We aim to emotionally enrich underrepresented players through gameplay and storytelling, and endear others to the struggles of our diverse characters with humor and unflinching honesty.

By 2025 the studio will be contributing to the conversation of diversifying perspectives in the industry through it's projects as well as provide fulfilling positions for BIPOC & LGBTQIA+ at our studio.
